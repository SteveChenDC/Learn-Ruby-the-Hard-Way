# Study Drills
#Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
# line 4, line 10, line 18, line 20, line 25
#Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
# Yes
#Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
# They combine the strings of w and e
# What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? Do they still work? Try to guess why.
# Doesn't work as intended. "" are used if you want string interp.
